# Traffic Light System (Java)

This Java program simulates a simple traffic light system. The traffic light alternates between red and green signals, and each signal lasts for 20 seconds. The program uses threads to manage the timing of the signals.

1. The program will print the current color of the traffic light and countdown in seconds.
2. The light will switch between red and green, and the countdown will reset after each cycle.
